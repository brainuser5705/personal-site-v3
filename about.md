I am a CS major at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-computer-science). Outsides of school, I like working on software projects, studying computer science, and (hate) stressing myself out unintentionally.

*(Last updated: 2021-08-02)*  

I have been coding seriously for about a year now and besides studying computer science, I got into (personal) software engineering and made several [projects](/projects.html). What I do is I come up with an idea, research, learn the necessary languages and tools, and try to code it as best as I can. 

My skills are pretty basic now; I don't specialize in any type of technology or language. All of my projects serve no great purpose, but I hope to get to a point where I can create useful software (whatever I might make) and contribute to open source projects. But before that, there is a lot I have to learn.

*Right now I am leveling up my skills by immersing myself into low-level programming, data structures/algorithms, and design patterns for software engineering.*
