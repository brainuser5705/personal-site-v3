*Here is a rough timeline of cmdline-minesweeper and its features. Unfortunately I didn't put any timestamps, but the project was in active development for about two months.*

##### **First run successful run! Right now the progam is able to generate a field with all the mines and numbers.**

##### **Top is the what the game displays as its current state (none of the blocks are revealed). Bottom is the actual content of the block.**

##### **Color with ANSI values (had to change the color scheme a little)**

##### **How to win the game: all the mines are flagged! In the first part, I had one flag left. When I flagged the remaining mine, I won the game.**
